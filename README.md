## ReactJS Bookstore Project Assignment

A SPA built with **React.js** on the frontend and the **SoftUni Practice Server** *(non-persistent)* for the backend.
This project showcases my abilities in **CRUD operations**, **user authentication**, **route protection**, the **React Context API**, and **custom React hooks**.
It was created to further develop my React skills and explore building a full-featured single-page application.

## Project Structure

├── client/ # React frontend 

├── server/ # SoftUni Practice Server backend


## How to run
- clone the repo

---

- Server: 
    - cd ./server (go to server dir)
    - node server (execute the command in terminal)
---
- Client:

    - cd client
    - npm install

    ---
    
    - npm run dev (this runs the project for development mode)

## ⚠ NOTE

The **SoftUni Practice Server** is **non-persistent** — all data will reset when the server restarts.  
This is intentional for learning purposes.
